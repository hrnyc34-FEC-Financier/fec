[ Introduction ]

Over the course of 12 days during our time at Hack Reactor, cohort 34, Team tres-leches composed 
of the astounding team of 3 developers, Claire Sujin Kim, Raymond Hunce, Tina Tkatchenko, 
was tasked to create a working backend of each of their respective parts to an API of an E-commerce site. 

Each of us was assigned to one piece of the API:

1. Products - Tina
2. Q & A - Raymond  
3. Reviews - Claire
